# Flappy-Bird

Flappy bird using NeuroEvolution of Augmented Topologies(NEAT). Based on the paper by the same name published by Kenneth O. Stanley and Risto Miikkulainen

Instead of training the neural network by providing past game data, this technique will use the genetic algorithm to gradually learn to play the game by itself. This is done by using NEAT.

In the traditional way, a neural network structure is defined and only the weights are updated along the training process. In this novel method, the structure of the network is not fixed. It keeps on improving itself by making changes to the structure as well as the weights.

This is like evolving a neural network using genetic algorithm.
